When I was eight years old, I dreamt of being a video game journalist.

This was the 1980s. Things were a little different back then. 

Magazines such as EGM, Nintendo Power, GamePro and Game Players were my inspiration. I'd never heard of the Internet.

One of those magazines had an article about fanzines- publications put together by fans and distributed through Ma and Pa video rental chains and mail order. 

By the time I was twelve, I'd put together my first issue. It was called Game Elite (named after a vacuum cleaner). The cover story was Boogerman for Genesis. All the screenshots had been cut out of professional magazines and scrap-booked in.

The Game Elite logo was designed by an awesome artist I knew from high school (Hi, Kim), and I'd brought in a few volunteers to write reviews.

All the text was produced on my typewriter.
